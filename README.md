# Simple-Starter-Kit

##### A simple starter kit for any web page, using pug, sass and js, managed with Gulp.

Gulp will:
  * Process Pug files
  * Process, autoprefix, and minify Sass files
  * Concatenate and minify JS files
  * Optimize images
  * Serve files from the dist folder on localhost:3000 and watch for any changes. <br>
  *(if it's a css change it will inject the new css without reloading the page, else it will refresh the page)*

## How to use it?

To use this kit, just download or clone the project, and once inside the root folder, using the cli type ***yarn*** (or ***npm install*** if you don't have yarn installed).<br>
Then just type ***gulp*** and it will launch the live server.
